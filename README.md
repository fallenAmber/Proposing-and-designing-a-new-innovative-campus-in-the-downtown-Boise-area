The City of Boise is soliciting your consulting team to propose and design a new innovative cam-pus in the downtown Boise area. They are seeking the following;

# 1) Building A that serves the local Boise business community.
# 2) Building B that serves the local treasure valley area citizens.
# 3) Building C that serves the BSU student community.
# 4) Building D that serves as the centralized IT dept that manages and serves all the buildings IT infrastructure and needs. 

Note: Building A-C are 2 story buildings and Building D is a 1 story building
The city of Boise does not have any budgetary constrain for the new campus. They are seeking high innovation and creativity for the new campus. This is a CAMPUS NETWORK architecture that adhere to CISCO 3 Tier Architecture Campus Network Framework and Design. 

Project Deliverables: 

1)	Part A: A MS Visio network diagram encompassing all the Buildings (A – D) with uniform no-tations used in the diagram for all the buildings (sizing, icon type, naming (You do not have to use an official naming convention yet), labelling …..etc). 

The final proposal network diagram must look like it was finished by a single consultant team. The network must adhere to CISCO 3 Tier Architecture Campus Design Framework with a top down design. A legend must be provided detailing all the connections used along with their speed (e.g. ISP Lines, VPNs, Trunk Lines, Access Lines, STP …etc). All node types must be clearly labeled and legible (e.g. Servers, Routers, Firewall, PC’s ….etc).

2)	Part B: All Subnetting info must utilize Private Network IP with the use of NAT (Network Ad-dress Translation). Public IP address must be used if there is any connection to the Internet and/or other network. All nodes must be labelled correctly with distinct IP address and VLAN (if applicable). All nodes (including all routers, switches, firewalls, Aps …etc.) must have a standardized and consistent naming convention throughout the entire campus network. Note: The following nodes do not need to have any IP address attached to it (Routers, Switches, Firewalls and All Servers). 

3)	A table of all subnet info (Subnet IP, CIDR, Subnet Mask, Usable IP addresses & Broadcast IP) must be included. This can be in a separate Excel spreadsheet. You must also identify all subnets on your network diagram and all the nodes that belong to that subnet.

4)	A minimum of the following servers in order to serve a working network; Web Server, Email Server, DHCP Server (To automatically provide IP addresses to nodes), DNS Server (To en-able Internet access by converting IP addresses to Domain Names), SNMP Server (To ena-ble remote management of all nodes in the network), Master Firewall Server (to manage and configure all firewalls in the network), DC Server (to manage all the nodes and users (username, password) in your network) and NAT Server (To translate Private IP addresses to Public addresses and vice versa).

5)	Group’s PowerPoint Presentation Slides must be professional and detailing the following; The group Info, The team’s approach to the project, The project proposal, The summary of each building design (why the design is superior and fits the requirements of the project sponsor (The City of Boise), The “killer” and unique features of each building that you add into your building design, Why the city of Boise should choose your team’s design and a conclusion. Note: The above are the minimum content requirements of your PowerPoint Presentation Slides and you are free and encouraged to add your own content.  1) Building A that serves the local Boise business community.
